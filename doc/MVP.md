**AsciiArtify** software product that converts images into ASCII-Art using Machine Learning algorithms. This approach enhances conversion quality by considering image-specific details for more precise rendering.

The goal is to demonstrate a fully functional GitOps pipeline, where application updates are automatically deployed to a Kubernetes cluster based on changes in a Git repo.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (k3d).
- ArgoCD cluster.
- GitHub repository with deployment manifests.
