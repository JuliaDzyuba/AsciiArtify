# Proof of Concept: ASCII-ARTIFY

## Goal
Develop a software product that converts images into ASCII-Art using Machine Learning algorithms. This approach enhances conversion quality by considering image-specific details for more precise rendering.


## Technical Details
### **k3d**
*K3d* is a lightweight tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters, enabling fast deployment of test environments. Advantages:
- Simple setup and rapid deployment.
- Efficient resource utilization compared to full-fledged Kubernetes.
- Easy integration with CI/CD workflows.

### **GitHub**
*GitHub* serves as the version control system for storing code and collaborating on the project. Advantages:
- Reliability and security of repositories.
- Convenient collaboration and version management.
- CI/CD integration for automation of development processes.

### **ArgoCD**
*ArgoCD* is a declarative GitOps system for Kubernetes that provides:
- Automated application deployment on the cluster.
- Visualization of deployment status via a graphical interface.
- Control and security for deployment processes.

## Expected Outcomes
- Set up the k3d cluster for local development.
- Implement the GitOps approach using ArgoCD.
- Ensure team access to the ArgoCD graphical interface for deployment management.

## Conclusions
This PoC will validate the feasibility of automating deployment through a Kubernetes cluster based on k3d. The next stage involves optimizing and integrating a full CI/CD pipeline.
